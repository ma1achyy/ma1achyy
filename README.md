# 👋 Hey, I'm Malachy

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m a  student at UH who’s into **cybersecurity, networks, and tech tinkering**. I like breaking stuff in labs, figuring out how it works, and then documenting it here.  

Right now I’m:  
- 🛠️ Building a **cyber lab** with honeypots, SIEMs, and traffic analysis tools  
- 🎯 Learning more about **offensive security & defense**  
- 🚀 Adding projects here as I go, so I can track my growth and share what I’m learning  

---

## 🔧 Stuff I Use
- **Languages & Scripting:** Python, SQL, Bash  
- **Cyber Tools:** Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, Zeek, Burp Suite, John the Ripper  
- **Networking & Systems:** Cisco Packet Tracer, Linux (Kali/Ubuntu), Windows  
- **Other:** Git/GitHub, Google Workspace  

---

## 📂 Projects You’ll Find Here
- 🕵️ **Honeypot Lab** — setting traps for attackers and analyzing the logs  
- 📡 **Traffic Analysis** — packet captures with Wireshark & Zeek  
- 🎮 **CTF Writeups** — TryHackMe / HackTheBox notes & solutions  
- 📊 **Mini-SOC Build** — experimenting with Splunk/Wazuh for detection  

*(I’ll be adding more as I go — this is basically my learning journey in public.)*
